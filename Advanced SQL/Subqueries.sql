Problem 1
Question:

Identify the top 5 skills that are most frequently mentioned in job postings. Use a subquery to find the skill IDs with the highest counts in the skills_job_dim table and then join this result with the skills_dim table to get the skill names.

Hints:

Focus on creating a subquery that identifies and ranks (ORDER BY in descending order) the top 5 skill IDs by their frequency (COUNT) of mention in job postings.
Then join this subquery with the skills table (skills_dim) to match IDs to skill names.
*/

SELECT skills_dim.skills
FROM skills_dim
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT skill_id
    FROM skills_job_dim
    GROUP BY skill_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(job_id) DESC
    LIMIT 5
    ) AS top_skills ON skills_dim.skill_id = top_skills.skill_id;

/*
Problem 2

Determine the size category ('Small', 'Medium', or 'Large') for each company by first identifying the number of job postings they have. Use a subquery to calculate the total job postings per company. A company is considered 'Small' if it has less than 10 job postings, 'Medium' if the number of job postings is between 10 and 50, and 'Large' if it has more than 50 job postings. Implement a subquery to aggregate job counts per company before classifying them based on size.

Hints:

Aggregate job counts per company in the subquery. This involves grouping by company and counting job postings.
Use this subquery in the FROM clause of your main query.
In the main query, categorize companies based on the aggregated job counts from the subquery with a CASE statement.
The subquery prepares data (counts jobs per company), and the outer query classifies companies based on these counts.

    company_id,
    name,
    CASE
	    WHEN job_count < 10 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN job_count BETWEEN 10 AND 50 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Large'

Problem 3

Find companies that offer an average salary above the overall average yearly salary of all job postings. Use subqueries to select companies with an average salary higher than the overall average salary (which is another subquery).

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

    - Start by separating the task into two main steps:
        calculating the overall average salary
        identifying companies with higher averages.
    - Use a subquery (subquery 1) to find the average yearly salary across all job postings. Then join this subquery onto the company_dim table.
    - Use another a subquery (subquery 2) to establish the overall average salary, which will help in filtering in the WHERE clause companies with higher average salaries.
    - Determine each company's average salary (what you got from the subquery 1) and compare it to the overall average you calculated (subquery 2). Focus on companies that greater than this average.
